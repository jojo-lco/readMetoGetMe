AS a developer I would like when a user decides to use my application, or when a fellow developer uses my application they are able to understand its use and contribute to how I can make it work better for them hence I created a README generator that facilitates this process.

2. Go to your terminal on your computer and run this command in the folder that you would like to generate the README.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jose-lco/readMetoGetMe.git
```
3. Open the folder with the repository. The first thing you would do is to install the dependencies. In order to do this, you would run npm install in the command line.
```
npm install 
``` 
4. To officially run the application, run this in the command line:

node index.js
```
## Usage

This is a CLI app that generates the README according to the user's input. The README will be generated in the same folder, right after you are done answering all the questions. You can add more content to your README as you please by opening and editing it.
